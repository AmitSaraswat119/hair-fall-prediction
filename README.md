# Hair Fall Prediction and EDA Website

## Project Title: Hair Fall Predictor

### Description:
Hair fall is a common problem affecting millions of people worldwide. In today's fast-paced lifestyle, stress, pollution, improper diet, and genetic factors contribute significantly to hair fall. Understanding the patterns and factors behind hair fall is crucial for effective prevention and management.

This project aims to address this issue by developing a Hair Fall Prediction Model and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on relevant datasets. By analyzing various factors such as age, gender, lifestyle, and environmental factors, we can gain insights into the causes of hair fall and predict the likelihood of an individual experiencing hair fall.

### How to Start:

#### For Mac:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate #Mac
   .\env\Scripts\activate  #windows

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Start the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py

Once the Flask app is running, you can access it through your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:5000/. The website will provide two options in the taskbar: "Home" and "Data Report." Clicking on "Data Report" will display various graphs generated from the EDA, and you can download the report by clicking on the appropriate buttons.
